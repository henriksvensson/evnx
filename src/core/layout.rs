//! Aligning a `.env` to the layout of a reference file (`evnx align`).
//!
//! The reference — normally the committed, ordered `.env.example` — decides
//! section headings, documentation comments, blank lines and key order. Each
//! target keeps every assignment it has, **as written**: the lines of an
//! assignment are moved as one slice of the original text and never parsed into
//! a value and written back, so quoting, escapes, `${VAR}` references, inline
//! comments and multiline values cannot change.
//!
//! ⛔ **Nothing here returns a value or a source line in an error.** A
//! [`LayoutError`] carries line numbers, key names and fixed wording only. The
//! parser's own `Display` for an invalid key quotes the key, which on a broken
//! line is often a pasted secret, so its errors are translated here rather than
//! passed on.
//!
//! # The layout rule
//!
//! The output is the reference, line by line, with each reference assignment
//! replaced by the target's assignment for that key (or the placeholder
//! `# KEY=` when the target has none). Reference comments and blank lines are
//! copied in place.
//!
//! # Keys the target lacks
//!
//! ⚠️ **A placeholder, never a blank assignment.** `KEY=` is not the same as an
//! absent key, measured on synthetic files: Node's `??` and Compose's `${KEY-d}`
//! read an empty string rather than the default, Compose's `${KEY?}` accepts it,
//! a later `--env-file` wipes an earlier real value, and `evnx sync --check` and
//! `evnx diff` stop reporting the key, so `sync --direction reverse` never fills
//! it. A comment changes none of that, which is what lets this module promise
//! that aligning a file does not change what any reader gets from it.
//!
//! The reference's value is never copied. Exactly `# KEY=`, for a key the
//! reference has, is evnx's own line: it is dropped once the key has a real
//! value, and `# KEY=something` is an ordinary comment.
//!
//! # The comment rule
//!
//! A target's full-line comments are sorted into three kinds, in this order:
//!
//! 1. **Reference-owned.** A comment whose text (trimmed) also appears as a
//!    comment in the reference is a copy of the reference's documentation. It
//!    is dropped from where the target had it, because the reference copy is
//!    written at the reference's position. When the target holds **more**
//!    copies of that text than the reference, which copy is the target's own
//!    cannot be decided, and the file is refused ([`LayoutError::AmbiguousComment`]).
//!    The extras heading ([`EXTRAS_HEADING`]) and a placeholder are owned the
//!    same way: evnx regenerates them on every run. Copies of a placeholder are
//!    never ambiguous, because the line holds nothing to lose.
//! 2. **Attached.** Any other comment with no blank line between it and the
//!    next assignment (reference-owned comments in between do not count as a
//!    gap) belongs to that assignment and moves with it, written directly above
//!    it, below the reference's documentation for that key.
//! 3. **Standalone.** Any other comment — one followed by a blank line or the
//!    end of the file before the next assignment — stays after the nearest
//!    assignment above it, as its own paragraph with a blank line on each side.
//!    One above every assignment is a preamble and stays at the top.
//!
//! Every target-only comment is kept; none is ever dropped. The output is
//! checked before it is returned: it must parse, hold every original
//! assignment byte for byte, lose no comment, and align to itself unchanged.
//!
//! # Keys the reference does not have
//!
//! They are kept at the end, in their original order, under
//! [`EXTRAS_HEADING`], each with its attached and standalone comments.
//!
//! # Line endings
//!
//! Lines evnx writes (reference comments, blank lines, `# KEY=`) take the
//! target's line ending. A target that mixes CRLF and LF is refused rather than
//! guessed at. Whether the file ends with a newline, and a UTF-8 byte-order
//! mark, are kept as the target had them.
